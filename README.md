# UrbanEdge: E-Commerce Web Application

**Description:**

UrbanEdge is a fully functional MERN Stack based e-commerce web application showcasing a variety of clothing, footwear, and jewelry. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, adding items to a cart, and simulating a checkout process. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a blend of front-end technologies for creating a dynamic and engaging online shopping experience.

**Key Features:**

*   **Product Catalog:** Organized product listings categorized into clothing, footwear, and jewelry, featuring discounts and detailed product information.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Functionality to add, remove, and adjust the quantity of items in a shopping cart. Includes subtotal, discount, shipping calculations, and simulated checkout.
*   **User Interface:** Responsive design with a clean and modern UI, optimized for various screen sizes.
*   **Contact Form:** An integrated contact form for users to reach out with inquiries.
*   **Signup/Login:** Basic signup and login form for user registration and authentication.
*   **About Us Section:** Details about the UrbanEdge brand and its team.

**Technologies Used:**

*   **HTML:**  Structural foundation of the web pages.
*   **CSS:** Styling and layout for a visually appealing design.
*   **JavaScript:** Interactive elements, cart functionality, and form validation.
*   **Font Awesome:** Icon library for UI elements.
  
**Setup and Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd UrbanEdge
    ```

2.  **Open the HTML files in your web browser:**
    *   The project is designed to be run directly by opening the HTML files in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Simply navigate to the `UrbanEdge/` directory and double-click on `home.html` to start the application.

**Caveats:**

*   **Front-End Only:** This project is a front-end demonstration and does not include server-side functionality for persistent data storage, user authentication, or payment processing.
*   **Simulated Cart:**  The cart functionality uses `localStorage` for temporary storage and simulates the checkout process. Actual e-commerce implementations require a database and server-side logic.
*   **Form Validation:**  Form validation is implemented on the client-side using JavaScript. Real-world applications should also include server-side validation for security.
*   **Image Links**: The Image link will not work once deployed.
*   **Navigation**: Navigation may not work once deployed.

**To-Do:**

*   Implement server-side components for data persistence.
*   Add user authentication and account management.
*   Integrate a real payment gateway for secure transactions.
*   Enhance the design and responsiveness for a better user experience.
*   Add additional features such as product reviews and wishlists.
